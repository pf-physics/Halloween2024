  ],
  "What's up?": ["Some bats, I reckon"],
  "Where do you sleep?": [
    "I dig myself up a new grave every night.",
    "Not a fan of coffins, myself. I prefer the nice soft dirt.",
  ],
  "Why are you trying to attract lost souls?": [
    "Lost souls need a place to rest every now an' then. We do our best to keep the place nice and welcoming.",
    "When they're here, they help us out with the upkeep of the graveyard.",
    "Then on Halloween, we throw em a party to thank em' for all they've done, and to showcase our graveyard to new lost souls.",

  "What do lost souls do to help?": [
    "Lost souls help with the upkeep of the graveyard.",

  "What are lost souls?": [
    "Lost souls are souls that ain't tethered.",
    "Most souls are tethered to their body, or home, or an object. They got some poltergeist powers near their tether.",
    "Without a tether, lost souls are poltergeists everywhere, and are free to wander the earth.",
    "These souls are free, but they got no home. Without a home, it's easy to lose yourself.",
  ],
  "What do lost souls gain by helping?": [
    "We give em' a place to rest, when they're tired, or if it's a new moon.",
    "With no tether, lost souls can forget emselves. If they been alone for too long, or if they're alone on a new moon, they lose emselves fully, and become corrupted souls.",
    "Corrupted souls have forgotten who they are, and wander the earth to find themselves. They absorb other lost souls to borrow their sense of self, but it gets more and more diluted with each soul.",
    "These things're dangerous. They can even split off into lil souls that obey the main body. Like zombies, but ghosts.",
    "I gotta be careful not to let any of those in. If it absorbs 1000 souls, it becomes strong enough to absorb souls right outta humans.",
  ],
  "Does everyone become a ghost when they die?": [
    "Some do. Some don't.",
    "Sometimes ghosts disappear from the graveyard. I dunno where they go, but the residents always seem happy for em.",
  ],
  "Can I live here when I die?": [
    "I like you getting yer affairs in order well ahead of time.",
    "I'll be sure to get you some nice soft dirt.",
  ],
  "Do you ever run out of space for graves?": [
    "Space expands with the graveyard.",
    "You ever get lost in a graveyard? It can go on forever if it needs to.",

  "Trick or treat!": [
    "Diggin' in the dirt all day, all I got are jawbreakers.",
